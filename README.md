# ibb-ears-detection-recognition

Project for Image Based Biometry handling ears detection+recognition pipeline.

## Overview
Detection using classical Viola-Jones cascade detector and CNN based one (using YOLOv4).

Recognition based on multiple CNN architectures (ResNet[18,34], VGG16, InceptionV3, Xception).

## Results
